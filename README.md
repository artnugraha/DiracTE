# DiracTE
Notes, derivations, and codes for thermoelectrics of Dirac materials. If readers benefit from this repository, please cite our paper: <strong>Optimal band gap for improved thermoelectric performance of two-dimensional Dirac materials</strong>. It is still under review in a journal but can be accessed freely at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03999">arXiv:1901.03999</a>.

There are two Jupyter (Python) notebooks in this repository:
- <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/artnugraha/DiracTE/blob/master/DiracTE.ipynb">DiracTE.ipynb</a> for the main results of our paper. The calculations are performed within the energy-dependent relaxation time approximation.
- <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/artnugraha/DiracTE/blob/master/DiracTE-CRTA.ipynb">DiracTE-CRTA.ipynb</a> for the results in Appendix. The calculations are performed within the constant relaxation time approximation.

For the best online rendering of the Python notebooks, please use <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/">nbviewer.jupyter.org</a> and type this GitHub repository address: <strong>artnugraha/DiracTE</strong>

E.H.H. initiated the project with A.R.T.N. and laid out the guideline for the calculations. L.P.A.K. and A.R.T.N. then wrote the Jupyter notebooks and coded numerically in Python based on  E.H.H.'s notes.  After the calculations were completed, B.E.G. and N.T.H. re-checked and confirmed the calculations.  All authors discussed the results and contributed to the writing of the paper.
